            "We needed new siding and called three different companies - more of which we were happy with. Finally we were talking with a neighbor, who had siding done by HomeCraft and she was very satisfied with their work. I called Rick and was very pleased with what he was showing us. I checked around and found out that CertainTeed was a very good product and had an excellent reputation. I'm so glad we went with him. He and his crew were on time, did what they said they would do and more! Very hard workers. Cleaned up after which was great. I have gotten so many compliments on how my house looks. I would highly recommend Rick and his crew to family and friends!"

            "In 2018 my husband and I received the services of Rick, owner and operator of Homecraft
            Exteriors. His company completed a roofing and siding project for us. We found his
            performance to be exemplary in every regard. His team demonstrated a high level of expertise,
            addressing all inquiries and questions with clarity and providing well-informed recommendations
            that significantly contributed to the project's success.
            We wound up deciding on a wonderful color which accentuated the aesthetic of the
            neighborhood as well as our own personal preference. Communication throughout the process
            was exceptional. Rick maintained consistent and transparent updates, ensuring that we were
            fully apprised of the progress and any relevant details. Rick was even the person to advise
            about roof color choice which can help enhance the exterior of the house. This communication
            fostered confidence with our choices and facilitated a smooth workflow for his employees.
            The project was completed with remarkable efficiency. Rick and his company stuck to the
            agreed timeline without compromising any quality anywhere. The final results were both
            aesthetically pleasing and functionally sound. We get compliments over and over about our
            house siding. Rick’s meticulous attention to detail really helped our home stand out in the
            neighborhood. Moreover, the pricing was highly competitive, offering substantial value for the
            caliber of work delivered.
            Rick from Homecraft Exteriors proved to be a highly competent and reliable provider. We would
            unequivocally recommend his services to those seeking professional excellence in roofing and
            siding projects."

            (Review From Google)"I have to say I don’t often leave reviews but Rick deserves a great review. Rick did a siding job on my house in 2016 and the job came out great, 16 years later my house still looks great, we still get compliments on how well it was done and how it held up. After all the high wind storms that we have gotten the past few years I have never lost a piece of siding. Rick took care of every one of my complaints, I admit, I am very hard to please and can find fault in anything, well as insignificant as they were he took care of it and satisfied me. I have recommended him to 3 different relatives and they were all satisfied. Now, I am recommending him to a neighbor for a roofing and siding job. Thank you Rick."
